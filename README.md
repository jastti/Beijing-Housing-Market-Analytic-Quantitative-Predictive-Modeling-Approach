# Beijing-Housing-Market-Analytic-Quantitative-Predictive-Modeling-Approach
The "Beijing Housing Market Analytic: Quantitative Predictive Modeling Approach" project employs a Multi-Linear Regression Model to dissect the complexities of Beijing's real estate market. This in-depth analysis harnesses a vast array of housing data, cleansed meticulously to ensure precision in forecasting. The final model selection used AIC, BIC, and data visualization.

#### Our Research Question: 
How did building type, property size, number of living rooms, number of bathrooms, ladder of ratio, presence of an elevator, kitchen, drawing room, and proximity to a subway station collectively influence Beijing’s house market between 2011 and 2017?

#### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aquaregis32/beijing-house-price-prediction
The purpose of the original dataset is to predict the house price in Beijing. Our research aims to find the relationship between house price and all predictors, like if the number of living rooms increases by one unit, how would the price-per-square change while holding other factors constant, will the price increase or not? Our research focuses more on the behaviour of consumers while there are different house options in the market.

Our study delves into the intricate factors influencing Beijing's housing market. We focus on diverse aspects like building type, size, number of rooms, and proximity to key infrastructure, drawing upon existing research for deeper insights. Using a multi-linear regression model, we aim to quantify how these elements collectively impact housing prices. Our approach, underpinned by a solid theoretical framework from peer-reviewed literature, allows us to explore linear correlations between variables and decipher their individual contributions to the pricing structure. This README provides an overview of our methodology and findings, offering a nuanced understanding of Beijing’s housing market dynamics.
